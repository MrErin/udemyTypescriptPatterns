# Dependency Inversion Principle

- High-level modules with complex logic should be easily reuseable and unaffected by changes in low-level modules which provide utility features.
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- If you apply the Open/Closed principle and Liskov Substitution principle, you will be applying Dependency Inversion as well.
