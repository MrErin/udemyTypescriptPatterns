# Single Responsibility Principle

- Everything has exactly one job. Don't create a class that updates data, displays it in the browser, and logs errors. Create separate classes/functions
- A class should have one and only one reason to change
- Describe what your class does. If you use the word "and", you're probably breaking this principle.
